- 👋 Hi, I’m @soelih
- 👀 I’m interested in ...pretty much scientific stuff and how the hell do I wrap worklife and education around being a mum
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...html coding for beginners
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...i'll better look up the word "collaborate" first before I answer this question
- 📫 How to reach me ...I'll add infos if I have more time

Finally I want to state that I'd wish we had 36 hours a day like in MIB, because finding/having/structuring/investing/taking
time for all the stuff I have or want or need to do is really challenging for me.. ^_^'
